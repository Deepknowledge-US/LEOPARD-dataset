# LEOPARD: Learning Elements of Operative Printed Arms Recognition Dataset

## Abstract
The rise of 3D-printed firearms poses a new security
challenge, as their plastic composition and modular design make
them difficult to detect even using X-ray scanning systems. There
are thousands of weapon designs freely available online, and
constantly evolving traditional datasets for training detection
models quickly become obsolete. This paper presents an auto-
mated synthetic data generation pipeline that rapidly converts
parts of 3D weapon models into highly realistic annotated
training datasets. Our approach combines procedural variations
in geometry and material properties with physics-based render-
ing to create diverse training samples that account for real-
world printing artifacts and scanning conditions. Experimental
results demonstrate that object detection models trained on these
synthetic data achieve â‰¥ 70% accuracy in identifying 3D-printed
weapon components, offering a scalable solution for the rapid
evolution of printable firearms. In addition to presenting a novel
methodology, we released a valuable dataset to the scientific
community to support the detection of this type of artifacts using
RGB images.
